# CompositionCheatSheetGenerator
Creates composition cheat sheets for Overwatch using Imagemagick based on the options the player has chosen.

You can use this tool over here: https://overwatch.fakegaming.eu/comptool/

If you clone this repo, you will need a webserver running PHP and have Imagemagick installed.

The HTML/Template is fairly barebones since I lack experience in them and I didn't want to add too many dependancies from the start

Example of what the tool looks like.
